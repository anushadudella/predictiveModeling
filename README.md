- This is a research project created in order to establish the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic (that was at its peak in 2020-2021) and the trends of mental health searches at that time using predictive modeling.
## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3 (If not, install using sudo apt install python3)

## An overview of the project
Essentially, there are three hypotheses that I am working with.
In a brief summary, here are the hypotheses that I am working to prove.
- **Hypothesis 1:** The COVID-19 pandemic increased the rates of google searches for depression, anxiety, and anorexia in one specific region.
- **Hypothesis 2:** The COVID-19 pandemic increased the rates of google searches for depression, anxiety, and anorexia more for a specific region than another.
- **Hypothesis 3:** COVID-19 trends in the US are predictive of the google searches for these mental health terms.

## What this program entails
I will now give you a brief explanation as to how I proved each one of my hypotheses and used predictive modeling to quantify the relationship between these two variables.
In order to get the data for the google searches for the mental health keywords, I used the google trends API. I also used the NYtimes released data from GitHub in order to get the COVID case data from that specific time-frame.
